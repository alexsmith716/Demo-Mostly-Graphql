# Demo-Mostly-Graphql

### ABOUT:

* This demo is mostly about graphql. 


### TODO (trying to figure out):
* Feature RESTfulExample: useEffect `setGoogleBookUseQuerySearch` will affect `searchString` of `useQuery` googleBooks via query-result `refetch`


### TODO (know how to fix):
* Refactor GoogleBookBook: `setBookFavorite` toggle will read and write to the cache


### Comments

* Will solve this but it's tough figuring. Docs are OK but alot of trial-and-error and testing it all.
